Managers have to balance the needs of fishers with the long term
sustainability of fish stocks. Index insurance is a new financial tool
that could help managers meet these goals. This paper examines how index
insurance could change the optimal harvest control rule for a fishery.
The model is a stochastic dynamic programming model that considers both
a growth and harvest shock. The model is solved using Value Function
Iteration. Preliminary results show that index insurance reduces the
optimal harvest control rule at all levels of biomass. Future steps
include expanding the model to include basis risk, robustness checks,
and simulating the stock and fisher benefits with the new policy
function.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Fishery management is the primary form of risk mitigation in fisheries
(Lane \emph{et al.} 1998; Hilborn \emph{et al.} 2020). Well designed
management policies can ameliorate biological and climatic shocks to
enhance long term sustainability of fish stocks and fisher income
(Cheung \emph{et al.} 2018). However, management policies do not
eliminate risk completely, and some actions may be unpopular with
fishing constituents (Sethi 2010; Hoefnagel and Vos 2017). Friction
exists between managers balancing the long term health of the fish stock
with the immediate income needs of fishing communities (Grainger and
Parker 2013; Par√©s \emph{et al.} 2015; Kvamsdal \emph{et al.} 2016).

In extreme circumstances when managers close fisheries due to severe
environmental or market distortions, few programs currently exist to
alleviate the financial loss of fishers. The Federal Disaster Relief
Program provides congressionally approved funds to fishers in the United
States (Bellquist \emph{et al.} 2021). European fishers receive
assistance through the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund. These
programs are often slow to respond, and inequitably distribute
proportionally larger funds to industrial vessels than small scale
fishers (Jeremy and O'Riordan 2020; Jardine \emph{et al.} 2020).

Index insurance is a promising new financial tool that could address
fisher income loss from environmental stochasticity (Watson \emph{et
al.} 2023). For example, marine heatwaves can lead to fishery closures
(Santora \emph{et al.} 2020; Szuwalski \emph{et al.} 2023). A weather
index built on sea surface temperature could trigger payouts for fishers
immediately. Index insurance delivers payouts fast and does not require
expensive claim verification making it a favorable tool to work in
fisheries.

Index insurance contains production risk moral hazards that incentivize
fishers to change their harvest. Management provides constraints on
these behavior change margins through the use of both input and output
controls. Input controls include gear specifications, vessel
restrictions, and effort caps while output controls specify total
allowable catch (TAC) in the form of quotas or catch limits on the
fishery as a whole (Bellido \emph{et al.} 2020). Output controls are
defined by harvest control rules where the manager uses stock
assessments to determine the current state of the stock and determines
allowable catch. Determinations are made on biological or economic goals
(Dichmont \emph{et al.} 2010; Free \emph{et al.} 2023). Both sets of
controls limit the adaptive margin fishers have to change their harvest
in response to insurance payouts. Fishers gain financial security with
insurance, and management policies can still meet biological objectives
without additional fishing pressure.

However, index insurance could change management policies. Index
insurance payouts in years where the manager needs to reduce quota may
ameliorate fisher resistance. Fishers may be more willing to accept
lower quotas if they have insurance to cover the loss. With this
consideration, index insurance could incentivize managers to pursue more
aggressive harvest control rules to protect fish stocks in the long run.
This paper is the first to examine the influence of index insurance on
fishery harvest control rules.

Specifically this research seeks to find how much managers would adjust
quota allocations when fishers are protected from different types of
risk with index insurance. Additionally, I examine whether insurance
contracts that protect from biological or productivity shocks have
different impacts on the optimal harvest control rule. Finally, I will
compare how much the harvest control rules adjusted to account for
insurance improve biological and financial measures of fishery health.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section~\ref{sec-hcr},
describes how current harvest control rules set policy under
uncertainty. In Section~\ref{sec-num} I develop a stochastic dynamic
programming model to determine the optimal harvest control rule with and
without index insurance. A preliminary model solution is calculated and
presented in Section~\ref{sec-res} using Value Function Iteration.
Initial results indicate index insurance does have an influence on
manager HCRs. Future steps for the research are discussed in
Section~\ref{sec-fut}. Insurance working in tandem with management may
provide stronger outcomes than either tool acting in isolation.

\hypertarget{sec-hcr}{%
\section{Background on stochastic harvest control rules}\label{sec-hcr}}

Fishery managers use harvest control rules to determine the TAC or
extraction rules each year to meet multiple biological and economic
objectives (Punt 2010; Liu \emph{et al.} 2016). The most robust HCRs
determine set catch limits after a stock assessment quantifies the
underlying biomass. The necessity of biological, catch, and economic
data leads the formulation of HCRs to be expensive (Hilborn and Ovando
2014; Bradley \emph{et al.} 2019). The benefits do outweight the costs
and fisheries that adopt robust HCRs have healthier fisheries (Costello
\emph{et al.} 2012; Mangin \emph{et al.} 2018). To limit some of the
challenge, most HCRs are modeled and determined under deterministic
settings without considering risk nor uncertainty.

Uncertainty has notable impacts on optimal harvest control rules. Early
linear control methods showed that constant escapement strategies
remains the preferred policy under uncertainty of future stock growth
(Ludwig 1979). Whether the optimal escapement was higher or lower than
the deterministic setting depends on the concavity of harvest costs
(Reed 1979). Different sources of uncertainty lead to more nuanced
results. Stochasticity in the current period through measurement error
or unobserved biological costs lead to optimal escapement levels that
vary depending on the expected volatility of future recruitment (Clark
and Kirkwood 1986; Sethi \emph{et al.} 2005). In this uncertainty,
output controls specifying harvest limits outperform input controls that
specify effort (Yamazaki \emph{et al.} 2009).

While the various forms and impacts of uncertainty have been
comprehensively studied in fisheries, few studies have integrated risk
preferences of the manager or fishers in the determination of optimal
harvest control rules (Andersen and Sutinen 1984; Kelsall \emph{et al.}
2023). Risk aversion drastically changes the optimal policy function.
Risk aversion leads to policies where quotas are set at more consistent
levels regardless of the stock level (Lewis 1981). Kelsall \emph{et al.}
(2023) isolated the impacts of risk aversion on optimal escapement into
investment, wealth, and gambling effects. The risky nature of the stock
encourages planners to set lower escapement to extract more now and
invest in a risk free alternative. My model will allow for both
intertemporal substitution and risk aversion because insurance both
smooths income and reduces risk\footnote{No need for certainty
  equivalent \(\mu\) terms}. This will allow us to capture all the
effects of index insurance on a managers decision.

No studies to date have used formal insurance programs in fishery
harvest control rules. The closest study to this design was done in
agriculture by M√ºller \emph{et al.} (2011). They allowed Kenyan
pastoralists to maximize the future stream of welfare with an index
insurance contract based on rainfall by choosing the amount of insurance
coverage, the amount of pasture to rest in bad years, and the threshold
for resting. However, the production choice variables were selected once
at the beginning of the year and does not reflect a true harvest control
rule. Their insurance moral hazard did influence the choice of
pastoralists input decicions, and led to more aggressive resting
strategies that could threaten the long term welfare gains of insurance.
Adapting a similar framework will help illuminate the effects of index
insurance, but adding an optimal policy function allows for more
structured adjustments to account for the long term effects.

In the next section I build a new fishery model where managers maximize
constituent fishers discounted utility over an infinite time horizon
when fishers have access to insurance. My model builds on elements
present in previous fishery models, namely Sethi \emph{et al.} (2005),
but adds a new layer of complexity by including index insurance.

\hypertarget{sec-num}{%
\section{Model}\label{sec-num}}

I consider a fishery in discrete time with a single fish stock. The
stock, \(b_t\), grows based on the residual escapement, \(s_t\), of fish
after harvest \(h_t\) and a future stochastic weather shock
\(z^\theta_{t+1}\) (Equation~\ref{eq-growth}).

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq-growth}{}{
\begin{aligned}
b_{t+1} &= z^\theta_{t+1} G(s_t) \\
s_t &= b_t - h_t
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq-growth}\end{equation}

The weather shocks are time independent and the distribution is known to
the manager. The manager uses a stock assessment to estimate the current
period biomass based on the observed \(z_t\) and inform a TAC.
Specifically, the TAC establishes the proportion of biomass fishers are
allowed to harvest. I choose this specification as it most closely
resembles the Actual Catch Limits (ACLs) policy used in the United
States. Fisher harvest is random through a stochastic shock
\(z^\omega_t\) (Equation~\ref{eq-harvest}). The randomness could
originate from measurement error in the stock at each period, in season
shocks that impact fishing, or the inherent randomness of fishing.

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq-harvest}{}{
h_t=f_tb_tz^\omega_t
}\label{eq-harvest}\end{equation}

Uncertainty in the current period is captured by \(z_t^\omega\), and
future uncertainty originates from \(z_{t+1}^\theta\). Each random
variables is mean centered at 1 with a known variance
\(\sigma^2_{\{\omega,\theta\}}\). Both random variables are time
independent, but could be correlated with each other. For example, a
marine heatwave could reduce the available stock of biomass while
simultaneously pushing fish out of common fishing grounds making it more
difficult for fishers to locate productive sites. The reduction would be
measured by \(z_t^\theta\) while the increased effort to locate fish
reflects \(z_t^\omega\). In general, the shocks will most likely be
independent as the growth shock should not impact a measurement error
nor would a storm influence the underlying stock. My baseline model will
assume the two shocks are independent, but later analysis will relax
this assumption as a means to test basis risk in the insurance
contracts.

Harvest is sold at the constant world price \(p\) and costs are convex
in harvest rate. Fishers are risk averse in regards to profit \(\pi\)
with concave utility (\(u'(\pi)>0\), \(u''(\pi)<0\)).

Insurance will modify fisher utility by ameliorating risk. A simple
exogenous insurance contract will payout the difference in observed
shocks and the defined trigger \(\bar z\) times a scale loading
\(\gamma\) indicative of the productivity of the fishery
(Equation~\ref{eq-indem}). In the exogenous case, \(\gamma\) is fixed at
profit when biomass is at maximum sustainable yield. Trigger and scale
loading are constant for eternity.\footnote{I would eventually like to
  model \(\gamma\) as a choice variable for the manager, but I am
  concerned about convergence with just one choice. For now, a simple
  robustness check would be to vary \(\gamma\) from 0 to \(\pi_{msy}\)
  to see which \(\gamma\) has the highest converged value function}
Insurance contracts can be defined on either shock.

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq-indem}{}{
\begin{aligned}
I(v)&=\max(0,\bar z - z^v_t)\gamma \\
v&\in\{\omega,\theta\}
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq-indem}\end{equation}

Fishers will pay an actuarially fair premium \(\rho=\mathbb{E}[I(v)]\)
in each period. I assume all contracts perfectly capture their indicies
and possess no basis risk. Not all risk will be covered as the other
shock will still be present. The insurance will modify utility as seen
in Equation~\ref{eq-ut}.

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq-ut}{}{
\begin{aligned}
u_t=\mathbb{E}[u(\pi_t(f_t,b_t,\omega_t)+\mathbb{I}[(v)])]\\
\mathbb{I}[(v)]=\begin{cases}
I(v)-\rho(v) & \text{if } v_t>\bar z \\
-\rho(v) & \text{otherwise}\end{cases}
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq-ut}\end{equation}

The manager maximizes the expected infinite stream of expected utility
(Equation~\ref{eq-npv}) with discount factor \(\beta \in(0,1)\).

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq-npv}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\max_{f_t} \sum_{t=0}^\infty\beta^t\mathbb{E}_t\left[u(f_t,\omega,\theta,I(v))\right]\\
\text{s.t. } b_{t+1}=z_{t+1}^\theta G(b_t-h_t)
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq-npv}\end{equation}

Before I move onto the Bellman formulation of Equation~\ref{eq-npv}, it
would be prudent to examine the timing of the model and how the
different insurance contracts will play out. An insurance contract built
on the biomass growth shock \(z^\theta_t\) will payout at the beginning
of the year before harvest occurs (Figure 1). All the information needed
to trigger will be observed by the manager, fishers, and insurance
company. Based on the observed \(z^\theta_t\) and payout \(I(\theta)\),
the manager will choose a harvest rate \(f_t\). While fishers harvest,
the current period shock \(z^\omega_t\) is observed. The actual harvest
will be recorded at the end of the year and the biomass will grow based
on the future growth shock \(z^\theta_{t+1}\). The manager will then
estimate the biomass for the next period and the cycle will continue.

An insurance contract built on the harvest shock \(z^\omega_{t+1}\) will
payout at the end of the year after harvest occurs (Figure 2). The
manager will make harvest choices \(f_t\) before knowing whether
insurance will benefit fishers. The effects of a pre or post harvest
payout could be stark. If the manager knows the stock is in poor
condition, they may be more willing to reduce harvest because the
fishers are covered from the closure through the insurance. The stock
could recover faster through the equation of motion. Alternatively, post
harvest payouts may have more subtle influence on how a manager would
define the Harvest Control Rule.

The Bellman for Equation~\ref{eq-npv} accounts for uncertainty in both
the current and future periods.

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq-bell}{}{
\begin{aligned}
V(b_t)=\max_{f_t} \mathbb{E}\left[u(f_t,z_t^\omega,z_t^\theta,I(v))+\beta V(z_{t+1}^\theta G(b_t-h_t))\right]
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq-bell}\end{equation}

The first order conditions that solve Equation~\ref{eq-bell} demonstrate
how insurance and management could complement each other
(Equation~\ref{eq-foc}).

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq-foc}{}{
\begin{aligned}
&\mathbb{E}[\pi'(f_t,z_t^\omega)U'(f_t,z_t^\omega,z_t^\theta,I(v))]=\beta \mathbb{E}[G'(b_t-h_t)V'(z_{t+1}^\theta G(b_t-h_t))] \\
&\mathbb{E}[\pi'(f_t,z_t^\omega)]\mathbb{E}[U'(f_t,z_t^\omega,z_t^\theta,I(v))]+\text{cov}[\pi'(f_t,z_t^\omega),U'(f_t,z_t^\omega,z_t^\theta,I(v))] \\
&=\beta \mathbb{E}[G'(b_t-h_t)]\mathbb{E}[V'(z_{t+1}^\theta G(b_t-h_t))] +\text{cov}[G'(b_t-h_t),V'(z_{t+1}^\theta G(b_t-h_t))]
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq-foc}\end{equation}

The expected marginal utility gain from current period harvesting (line
2 of Equation~\ref{eq-foc}) must exactly equal the expected marginal
utility gain of future fish (line 3 of Equation~\ref{eq-foc}). There are
two wealth and investment effects, one for each period. The marginal
value of current profit, \(\mathbb{E}[\pi']\), is the immediate wealth
effect and is matched by future wealth in the marginal value of future
fish stocks \(\mathbb{E}[G'(b_t-h_t)]\).

The investment effect is more nuanced. The risk fishers take on now,
\(\text{cov}[\pi',U']\), has a corresponding risk in the future,
\(\text{cov}[G'(b_t-h_t),V']\), which dictates how much risk fishers are
willing to take on now or later. Insurance will affect both these
effects. Insurance lowers the variance of utility by equalizing bad and
goods states. The covariance of the shocks will lower with less variance
in utility. The relative magnitude of reduction in present or future
covariance will determine how the harvest control rule is defined.
Additionally, it will depend on which wealth effect takes up the margin.
Both of these impacts will depend on the type of insurance contract
specified. For example, a contract built on current period shocks
\(z_t^\omega\) will most likely have a larger impact on the current
period investment effect, lowering \(\text{cov}[\pi',U']\). Does the
manager respond to this reduction by raising immediate harvest to
extract more wealth now\footnote{The structure of the current model is
  implicitly risk increasing in the current period. I would like to
  introduce risk decreasing specifications, but I worry that the
  structural form of risk decreasing harvest will not work in value
  function iteration. The \(f^{-\beta}\) adds huge amounts of risk when
  \(f\) is low. So if the manager needs to close the stock for
  biological purposes, the risk reducing form will never want a closure
  because the risk will be astronomical.} or does the manager lower
harvest in response to the bad state of the world and tradeoff for more
future wealth? The complexity of the problem eliminates tractable
analytical solutions. In the next section I use numerical methods to
approximate the optimal harvest control rule with and without insurance
for a manager with risk averse fisher preferences.

\hypertarget{numerical-solution-methods}{%
\subsection{Numerical Solution
Methods}\label{numerical-solution-methods}}

Dynamic Programming will find the optimal policy function \(f(b^*)\) to
define a harvest control rule for each observed \(b_t\). I consider two
approaches to solve the model, both use Value Function Iteration. The
first approach discretizes the distributions of both shocks into
predefined bins using Markov transition probabilities
(Figure~\ref{fig-omega}). Then the algorithm iterates over each
combination of shocks and states. It maximizes the current expected
utility over each \(z_t^\omega\) and the future utility over each
\(z_t^\theta\) bin by selecting \(f(b^*)\). The algorithm continues to
iterate until the value function \(V(b)\) converges to the same future
value function \(V_{t+1}(b)\).

The first approach suffers from the curse of dimmensionality. More
precise answers require more bins and states. The search space can
become prohibitively large. Approximate dynamic programming uses Monte
Carlo simulation to approximate future value functions after decisions
are made in the current period (Powell 2011). This setting might be
particularly well suited for ADP as I can jointly sample both
\(z_t^\omega\) and \(z_t^\theta\) simultaneously. Expected value of
insurance needs to be calculated through Monte Carlo simulation. The
algorithm will iterate over each \(b_t\) to select \(f(b^*)\) until the
value function converges.

\subsection{Structural forms}\label{structural-forms}}

I consider two concave utility forms for the fishers: Constant Relative
Risk Aversion and Constant Absolute Risk Aversion. When the risk
aversion parameter \(\eta=1\) I add a sufficient high constant, \(k\) to
profits to ensure I do not take negative logs. This will not interfere
with the optimization procedure as the marginal utility defines the
convergence.

\[
u(\pi,I(v))=\begin{cases}
\frac{\pi^{1-\eta}}{1-\eta} & \text{if } \eta\neq 1 \\
\log(\pi+k) & \text{if } \eta=1
\end{cases}
\]

Convex costs are modeled through a squared cost function. The cost
parameter \(c\) is set to ensure choices of harvest are positive for
most levels of fish stock. Harvest is defined above through
Equation~\ref{eq-harvest}.

\[
\pi(f_t)=p f_t b_tz^\omega_t - c f_t^2
\]

The growth function is a logistic growth function. The growth parameter
\(r\) is set to ensure the stock does not go extinct. Carrying capacity
\(K\) is the upper bound of stock abundance. Next period biomass grows
on the residual escapement of fish after harvest \(s_t=b_t-h_t\).

\[
b_{t+1}=z_{t+1}^\theta \left[s_t+ r s_t(1-\frac{s_t}{K})\right]
\] The multiplicative nature of the shocks require distributions with
\(\mathbb{E}=1\) and all realizations must be greater than 0. Lognormal
distributions provide both properties by ammending the \(mu\) parameter
of the distribution. Lognormal distributions in expectation are
\(\mathbb{E}[X]=\exp(\mu+\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2)\). Setting the expectation
to 1 and solving for \(mu\) in terms of \(\sigma^2\) allows me to center
the distribution around 1 with only positive shocks.

\[
\begin{aligned}
z_t^\omega &\sim \text{Lognormal}(-\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2_\omega,\sigma^2_\omega) \\
z_t^\theta &\sim \text{Lognormal}(-\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2_\theta,\sigma^2_\theta)
\end{aligned}
\]

\section{Preliminary Results}\label{sec-res}}

I test a quick preliminary run of the model using only the growth shock
and the Markov transition probability approach. Index insurance appears
to reduce the optimal HCR at all levels of biomass
(Figure~\ref{fig-hcr}). The new policy function slightly approaches a
risk neutral specification. This matches predictions that insurance
allows risk averse users to behave more like risk neutral ones.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{docs_files/figure-pdf/fig-hcr-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-hcr}Optimal harvest control rules with insurance
(yellow), no insurance (blue), and a risk neutral manager (green) with
no insurance.}

\end{figure}

At all levels of biomass, insurance reduces harvest relative to the risk
averse manager with no insurance (Figure~\ref{fig-pct}). The overall
effect is small, but the percent difference in harvest can be quite
large especially at low levels of biomass. Managers are more inclined to
invest in future wealth of the stock if uncertainty in the current
period is reduced. Insurance allows managers to purse strategies that
reduce harvest pressure on the stock, increasing future value and
providing biological conservation.

rules between insurance and no insurance at every level of biomass.}

\hypertarget{sec-fut}{%
\section{Future Steps}\label{sec-fut}}

The results of the preliminary analysis are promising, but there remain
several steps to complete. The necessary goals are summarized below with
strategies to resolve each.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Expand to two shock framework}
\end{itemize}

The model currently only considers the growth shock.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Introduce basis risk}
\end{itemize}

Allowing the shocks to be correlated with each other can act as a proxy
for basis risk. Basis risk is detrimental to the uptake of insurance.
Assuming independence implies there will always be a residual amount of
risk that cannot be insured. The degree to which the shocks are
correlated could impact the structure of the HCR in unexpected ways.

A copula will link the weather variables together for correlation
coefficients between 0 and 1. Copulas are preferred in this instant as
they allow me to easily specify an correlation and distribution for both
shocks. The VFI solutions will sample from the multivariate copula to
extract harvest and biological shocks. The VFI procedure will be
repeated for each to assess the impact of basis risk on the HCR.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Model Robustness Checks}
\end{itemize}

There are a variety of parameters that need to be checked to understand
the full range of impacts insurance will have on the HCR. The amount of
insurance \(\gamma\) for either contract needs to be varied to ensure
that optimal insurance coverage is selected to not bias the results with
over or under insurance. The smoothness of the Value function will
determine whether \(\gamma\) could be included as a choice variable in
Equation~\ref{eq-bell}. The jaggedness of the converged value function
in Figure~\ref{fig-hcr} indicates this may be problematic. Instead, I
will vary \(\gamma\) from 0 to pre-insurance profits at Maximum
Sustainable Yield levels of biomass to identify an optimal value of
\(\gamma\).

Risk aversion and the time value of utility will also affect the impacts
of insurance on the optimal HCR policy. Greater risk aversion may lead
to increased insurance value that encourages stronger responses from the
manager. The isoelastic parameter \(\eta\) will be varied with
reasonable estimates from the financial literature or possibly from
studies that calculate fisher risk aversion. The discount rate will also
be varied to adjust the time value of money.

Lastly, the relative and absolute amounts of variance from the shocks
will be tested assess the changes in the optimal HCR. Sethi \emph{et
al.} (2005) showed more variance from measurement error shock that is
similar to my \(z_t^\omega\) has large impacts on the optimal HCR.
Insurance mitigates these risks and the amount of correlation between
this shows could provide interesting interactions as a result.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Simulate the stock and fisher benefits with new policy
  function}
\end{itemize}

The model will be simulated with the new policy function to assess the
impacts of insurance on the stock and fisher income. Probability of
stock extinction after 50 years will be calculated for each optimal
insurance policy\footnote{In the event that the HCR do not lead to
  extinction, I will calculate the mean and variance of stock levels at
  50 years}. Monte Carlo simulation with 1,000 draws of 50 years will
use the HCR and growth function to examine the distribution of stock
health and fisher utility.
