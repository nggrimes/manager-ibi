  Fisheries are vulnerable to environmental shocks that impact stock health and fisher income. Index insurance is a promising financial tool to protect fishers from environmental risk. However, insurance will change fisher's behavior through moral hazards. We provide the first theoretical application of index insurance on fisher's behavior change to predict if index insurance will incentivize overfishing or conservation of the stock. Using traditional fishery models will always bias index insurance to incentivize overfishing, which in turn reduces fish stocks. However, using models with more flexible input risk effects shows index insurance will have varying effects on fishery conservation. The direction of change depends on the risk characteristics of the inputs. We find that index insurance will raise (lower) individual fisher effort when effort is risk increasing (decreasing). In turn, higher (lower) fishing effort reduces (increases) conservation of fish stocks. The direction of harvest change becomes ambiguous when accounting for interaction between multiple inputs. Simulating from parameters estimated for four Norwegian fisheries shows index inusrance could increase harvest as high as 15% or decrease harvest by 6%. Before widespread adoption, careful consideration must be given to how index insurance will incentivize or disincentivize overfishing.

# Introduction

Fishing is a vital economic engine to coastal communities and is the primary source of protein for millions of people [@Sumaila2012;@Teh2013;@fao2020]. Supporting these communities requires protection from enormous degrees of environmental risk. Environmental fluctuations directly impact fishers of all scales from large industrial vessels to small scale subsistence fishers.

Marine heatwaves provide a clear example of how environmental variability impacts fishery biological and economic productivity. Marine heatwaves increase animal thermal stress diminishing reproductive ability [@Barbeaux2020], stunting growth [@Pandori2019], pushing species outside their usual habitats [@Cavole2016], and may directly increase mortality [@Smith2023]. Expanding fish habitat ranges increase costs when moving beyond the fishing grounds of established ports [@rogers2019]. The variability from marine heatwaves alone impacts 77% of species within economic exclusion zones and reduces maximum catch potential by 6% [@Cheung2021]. Marine heatwaves are often accompanied by harmful algal blooms and diseases leading to additional fishery collapses [@Oken2021]. 


Weather can also impact fisher harvesting efficiency beyond influencing the health of the underlying stock. Rolling seas and high wind speeds make it more difficult to harvest [@Alvarez2006] in addition to raising the danger to crew and vessel [@Heck2021]. More intense storms threaten coastal infrastructure vital to fishing communities [@Sainsbury2019]. Fishers actively avoid fishing in destructive weather at the expense of lost income [@Pfeiffer2020].

Individual choices by fishers and fishery management mitigate environmental risk. Fishers are highly sensitive to risk, especially income risk, and demonstrate risk aversion despite working a seemingly risky profession [@Smith2005;@Holland2008;@Sethi2010]. Individual efforts to mitigate risk such as choosing consistent, known fishing grounds over risking exploring unknown spots [@Holland2008] or choosing to fish less after storms and hurricanes [@Pfeiffer2020;@Pfeiffer2022] are likely to be incomplete and that financial tools like insurance could further help fishers. However, there is a lack of financial tools available to fishers to address income risk as a result of environmental fluctuations [@Sethi2010;@Kasperski2013]. There is growing interest in developing new financial tools to alleviate financial and income risk for coastal communities [@sumalia2020;@Wabnitz2019].

Insurance may be an ideal financial tool for risk management in fisheries as it is scalable, protects against environmental shocks, and smooths income for fishers [@Watson2023]. Currently, insurance in fisheries is primarily used to protect assets such as vessel hulls or fishing gear [@fao2022]. Insurance coverage could be expanded to include income variability originating from weather and biological productivity shocks. An insurance product covering these environmental risks could improve fisher welfare and promote community resilience [@Maltby2023]. 

Policy makers have begun advocating for new fisheries insurance programs modeled after agricultural crop insurance programs [@Murkowski2022]. Index insurance is one such product extolled by practitioners as a prime candidate for fisheries productivity insurance [@Watson2023]. Index insurance gained traction in agriculture as an effective alternative to traditional crop insurance in developing countries because it had lower administrative cost, minimized moral hazards, and does not require claim verification [@Carter2017;@Collier2009]. Whereas indemnity crop insurance requires an assessment of loss to an individual farm, index insurance uses an independent measure as the basis for issuing payouts to all policyholders. For example, a pilot program through the Caribbean Oceans and Aqauculture Sustainability Facility (COAST) uses index insurance to payout a set amount to fishers when indices of wave height, wind speed, and storm surge indicate a hurricane [@Sainsbury2019]. Triggers are the index values that initiate a payout. Contract design revolve around establishing suitable triggers to cover environmental loss. 

One crucial area that remains under studied is the potential influence of insurance on fishers behavior. Moral hazards are decisions by insured agents that they would not otherwise take if they were uninsured [@Wu2020]. Currently, the operational assumption of practitioners appears to be that index insurance would completely avoid any moral hazards in fisheries and intrinsically motivate greater fishery sustainability [ORAA?]. Yet, there are two components to insurance moral hazard: "chasing the trigger" and "risk reduction".  "Chasing the trigger" is the directed behavior of policyholders to increase the likelihood of a payout. For example, a fisher actively choosing to fish less to receive an indemnified harvest insurance payment. Index insurance completely eliminates this moral hazard through the independent and uninfluenced index (fishers cannot affect sea surface temperature). "Risk reduction" occurs through possessing an insurance contract that protects policyholders from risk. Policyholders may reoptimize their decisions once protected from risk. Index insurance remains susceptible to this element of moral hazard that could manifest in maladaptive behaviors. In fisheries, it could be choosing to fish more when insurance covers losses. All preliminary analyses of fisheries index insurance are missing rigorous assessment of this element of moral hazards. 

Previous studies in agriculture provide compelling evidence that behavior change ought to be expected in fisheries. Index insurance applied to grazing in pasture commons shows clear evidence of risk reduction moral hazards [@Bulte2021;@muller2011]. Other studies from agriculture describe a more equivocal relationship between insurance and environmental sustainability. The impact of insurance on environmental sustainability depends on the underlying risk reducing or increasing qualities of inputs used in production [@Mishra2005;@Ramaswami1993;@Mahul2001]. Risk increasing inputs will always lead to increased input use with insurance, while risk decreasing inputs will always lead to decreased input use with insurance. Numerous agricultural studies confirm insurance incentivizes changes in inputs [@Deryugina2017;@Claassen2017;@Goodwin2004;@Cai2016;@Mishra2005;@Claassen2017;@horowitz1993;@Babcock1996;@Smith1996;@Elabed2016;@Sibiko2020;@stoeffler2022]. 

Fisheries differ from agriculture in crucial ways, which gives merit to analyzing the behavioral effects of index insurance in this new setting. Previous studies articulated hypothetical examples of moral hazards in fishery indemnity insurance programs, such as encouraging fishers to fish in foul weather or to not exit the fishery after a bad year of harvest [@Watson2023;@Herrmann2004]. However, neither study built testable models to uncover moral hazard impacts on fisheries. This paper is the first to build a theoretical framework that will better predict the long term sustainability of index insurance programs in fisheries.

Stock abundance is a necessary input in fisheries production, and is a major source of production uncertainty. Fishers will always face biological risks because of the stochastic nature of fish growth. However, fishers can also face production risk from weather shocks that do not directly impact the stock of fish. For example, storms do not impact the underlying stock of fish, but greatly increase the production risk of fishers. Fishers may not be able to influence the variance of stock abundance, but they do make choices to limit other forms of risks. We present a new model that introduces both biological and production risk in fisheries to better accommodate existing individual fisher risk mitigation strategies. With an adaptive, more flexible specification of production, we test how index insurance will incentivize behavior change in fisheries with multiple sources of risk.

The remainder of the paper structured as follows. @sec-jp demonstrates the limitations of traditional fishing models in risk specification and presents a new model with more flexible risk components. @sec-common proves that index insurance will change fisher behavior, but the outcomes are ambiguous and depend on the risk of effects of inputs and the interaction between shocks. @sec-bio shows how the changes in fisher behavior will change fish stocks by adding a simple biological framework on the new production model. @sec-multi extends the theoretical model to account for multiple inputs in fishing. @sec-sim numerically estimates potential harvest changes with an index insurance program. Parameters are calibrated with an application to Norwegian fisheries through the results of @Asche2020. @sec-disc concludes with a discussion on the suitability of fishery index insurance. Fishery index insurance ultimately has ambiguous effects on fisher behavior. Before widespread adoption, careful consideration must be given to how insurance will incentivize or disincentivize overfishing. 


# Risky Production in Fisheries {#sec-jp}

Traditional fishery models assume the origin of production uncertainty stems from a multiplicative biomass shocks on production (@eq-y).

$$
y=g(X)\tilde{B}
$${#eq-y}

Where production $y$ comes from a harvest technology function $g(X)$ that uses a vector of $m$ inputs $X\in\{x_1,x_2,...x_m\}$. This form is intuitive and a natural starting point for adding stochasticity to fishery production. Random biomass $\tilde{B}$ can be separated into a mean component $\hat{B}$ and a variance component $\theta$ where $\theta$ can have any distribution so long as $\mathbb{E}[\theta]=0$ (@eq-fishp).

$$
y=g(X)\hat{B}+g(X)\theta
$$ {#eq-fishp}

This formulation is often referred to as process error, where randomness could originate from weather shocks in the current period or measurement error [@Merino2022;@Tilman2018]. Greater realizations of biomass lead to corresponding increases in production. However, @Just1979 show that this general class of production functions are implicitly risk increasing with standard forms in $g(X)$ such as Cobb-Douglas, linear, or translog, because of their concavity $g_{x}(X)>0$. The risk increasing nature of these models will always lead to overfishing with index insurance following the results found in @Bulte2021, @Ramaswami1993, and @Mahul2001. 

For example, the most widespread fishing production function originates from the Gordon-Schaefer model where $y=qx\tilde{B}$^[Traditionally, Gordon-Schaefer uses $e$ as the single input to denote aggregate fishing effort. To stay consistent with the terms used in this paper we present it as $x$ for a single input]. Expanding the stochasticity of biomass, production in Gordon-Schaefer becomes $y=qx \hat{B}+\theta qx$. The derivative of the risk component of the production function is always positive, $h_{x}(x)=q$, because the catchability coefficient $q$ is positive by definition. Thus, index insurance will always increase effort in aggregate linear effort models.

However, most fishery models have limited applications of risk and risk aversion that do not match observed behavior. For instance, fishery models with concave utility always predict lower optimal effort than risk neutral preferences [@gibbons1993;@Tilman2018;@Tromeur2021]. Yet risk averse fishers appear to consistently over harvest without management constraints. To reconcile these discrepancies, perhaps more flexible production functions can fill this gap.

Fishers make decisions along multiple margins ranging from daily to seasonal temporal scales. Across all these decisions appears to be choices that mitigate some levels of production risk [@Holland2008]. Fishers also have the ability to influence the degree of risk exposure through technical expertise and skill of captains that limits "luck" in fishing [@Alvarez2006;@Kirkley1998;@Kompas2004].   

Empirical testing in two case studies indicates fishers are making decisions along these margins and different types of inputs have unique risk effects. @Eggert2004 modeled the Swedish trawler fleet's gear choices with Just and Pope production functions, and found that fishers account for both the expected revenue and the variance of revenue when choosing what type of gear to deploy. They do not provide explicit estimates of which gear is risk increasing or decreasing, but the results suggest that fishers are sensitive to the risk effects of gear. @Asche2020 provides the only known estimate of the risk effects of inputs in fisheries. Fishery inputs possess both risk increasing and decreasing qualities that change depending on the exact nature of the fishery. 

Each of these studies occurred in well managed fisheries where quotas could reduce the biological risk component. We believe it is worthwhile to explore how index insurance could impact fisher behavior in unconstrained settings where biological risk and fishers ability to mitigate risk are equally pronounced. To do so, we allow fisher production to include risk mitigation of weather variables separate from those that impact biological variation.

$$
y=f(X)\hat{B}+\theta f(X)+\omega h(X)
$$ {#eq-jpfish}

@eq-jpfish is a more general form of fishery production that separates the risk effects of inputs from the biological risk. The biological risk is captured by $\theta f(X)$, and is always risk increasing as $f(X)$ is the concave production used by fishers to capture fish, $f_x(X)>0,f_{xx}(X)<0$. The risk effects of inputs are captured by $\omega h(X)$, where $h(X)$ can be risk increasing or decreasing, $h_x(X)\lessgtr0$. Both random variables can have any distribution so long as the means are centered around zero while variance may differ, $Var(\theta)=\sigma_\theta^2$ and $Var(\omega)=\sigma_\omega^2$. 

Weather variables typically associated with biological productivity such as sea surface temperature, upwelling, or primary production are good representations of what $\theta$ could capture. Any shock to production that is not directly related to the stock of fish would be captured by $\omega$. For example, storms do not impact the underlying stock of fish, but greatly increase the production risk of fishers. Shocks could also include regulatory requirements such as early season closures due to risk of whale entanglements or domoic acid outbreaks.

In the next section we examine the conditions under which index insurance will raise or lower fisher input use with a risk adaptive fishery production function. Adding two specifications of risk differs from previous index insurance models. It is imperative to derive results that suitably characterize the new fishery production modeled in @eq-jpfish.


# Index insurance in fisheries {#sec-common}

Fishers derive utility from profits and are price takers, so we add a convex cost function to @eq-jpfish and normalize price of harvest to 1.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\pi=f(X)\hat{B}+\theta f(X)+\omega h(X)-c(X)
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-pi1}


To most seamlessly integrate index insurance, we create insurance lotteries by defining a trigger, $\bar\omega$, where insurance pays out a constant amount $\gamma$ if $\omega<\bar\omega$. The separation of two random variables introduces basis risk into insurance contracts as a contract triggered solely on $\omega$ can not protect against all the biological risk of $\theta$. No prior study has examined basis risk on the optimal input use before, but it is well known to change the optimal insurance choice in agriculture [@Clarke2016;@Lichtenberg2022]. Therefore, we leave it as a feature, but will have to impose stronger conditions to achieve some tractable analytical results. During the numerical simulations, we can test the effects of basis risk more clearly.

We use $\omega$ to create an index to indemnify payouts because fisher inputs could take steps to reduce risk through $h(X)$. An index on $\theta$, while possible, will always be risk increasing through $f(X)$ and therefore will always increase optimal input use. 
 
Actuarilly fair insurance allows the premium, $\rho$, paid in both states to be the probability of receiving a payout times the payout amount, $\rho=J(\bar\omega)\gamma$, where $J(\omega)$ is the cumulative distribution of $\omega$. Additionally, if we set the trigger to $\bar\omega=0$ to indicate any time weather negatively impacts production, profits will enter corresponding bad and good states. This leads to the following lemma:

:::{#lem-mp}
Individual fisher expected marginal profit of a specific input, $x_m$, is greater in the good state than expected marginal profit in the bad state when $h_{x_m}(X)>0$. Expected marginal profit is higher in the bad state when $h_{x_m}(X)<0$.
:::

The proof of @lem-mp is included in the appendix.

Risk aversion is a necessary condition for insurance to be desirable [@Outreville2014]. Therefore, we assume fishers are risk averse to income shocks through a concave utility function. Fishers will maximize their own expected utility across good and bad states by selecting inputs with an exogenous insurance contract.

$$
\begin{aligned}
U\equiv\max_{X}\mathbb{E}[U]=\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}&\left[ \int^{\bar\omega}_{-\infty}j_{\omega,\theta}(\omega,\theta)u(\pi(X,\hat{B},\theta,\omega)+(1-J(\bar\omega))\gamma)d\omega \right.\\
&\left.+\int^{\infty}_{\bar{\omega}}j_{\omega,\theta}(\omega,\theta) u(\pi(X,\hat{B},
\theta,\omega)-J(\bar\omega)\gamma)d\omega\right] d\theta
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-max}


The general model in @eq-max is a flexible framework that can be applied to any fishery production model. Basis risk is captured by the joint distribution $j_{\omega,\theta}(\omega,\theta)$. Fishers will make inputs decisions on the distributions of both $\omega$ and $\theta$ to maximize their expected utility. 

We first examine the effects of index insurance on optimal input decisions for one input, $X\in\{x\}$. The first order condition that solves @eq-max is then:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial U}{\partial x}=&\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}\left[ \int^{\bar\omega}_{-\infty}j_{\omega,\theta}(\omega,\theta)u_{x}(\pi(x,\hat{B},\theta,\omega)+(1-J(\bar\omega))\gamma)\frac{\partial \pi}{\partial x}(x,\hat{B},\theta,\omega)d\omega\right.\\
&\left.+\int^{\infty}_{\bar{\omega}}j_{\omega,\theta}(\omega,\theta) u_{x}(\pi(x,\hat{B},\theta,\omega)-J(\bar\omega)\gamma)\frac{\partial \pi}{\partial x}(x,\hat{B},\theta,\omega)d\omega\right] d\theta\\
&=0
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-foc1}

To find the impact of insurance on optimal input, we use the implicit function theorem on the first order conditions.

$$
\frac{\partial x^{*}}{\partial \gamma}=-\frac{\frac{\partial U}{\partial x \partial \gamma}}{\frac{\partial^2 U}{\partial x^{2}}}
$$

By the sufficient condition of a maximization problem, $\frac{\partial^2 U}{\partial x^{2}}$ is negative so we can focus solely on the numerator to sign the impact of insurance on optimal individual input. 

Differentiate equation @eq-foc1 with respect to insurance.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{U}{\partial x \partial \gamma}=\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}\left[ \int^{\bar\omega}_{-\infty}j_{\omega,\theta}(\omega,\theta)u''(\pi(x,\hat{B},\theta,\omega)+(1-J(\bar\omega))\gamma)\frac{\partial \pi}{\partial x}(x,\hat{B},\theta,\omega)(1-J(\bar\omega))d\omega\right.\\
+\left.\int^{\infty}_{\bar{\omega}}j_{\omega,\theta}(\omega,\theta) u''(\pi(x,\hat{B},\theta,\omega)-J(\bar\omega)\gamma)\frac{\partial \pi}{\partial x}(x,\hat{B},\theta,\omega)(-J(\bar\omega))d\omega\right] d\theta
\end{aligned}
$$

Now we have to provide more structure to pull out tractable results. 

:::{#prp-ind}
For feasible index insurance contracts specified at trigger $\bar\omega=0$, when $\omega$ and $\theta$ are independent random variables, optimal fisher input will decrease when $h_x(x)<0$ and increase when $h_x(x)>0$.
:::

:::{.proof}

Independence of $\omega$ and $\theta$ allows us to factor out the joint distribution in the integral into the respective marginal distributions.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{U}{\partial x \partial \gamma}=\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}j_{\theta}(\theta)\left[ \int^{\bar\omega}_{-\infty}j_{\omega}(\omega)u''(\pi(x,\hat{B},\theta,\omega)+(1-J(\bar\omega))\gamma)\frac{\partial \pi}{\partial x}(x,\hat{B},\theta,\omega)(1-J(\bar\omega))d\omega\right.\\
+\left.\int^{\infty}_{\bar{\omega}}j_{\omega}(\omega) u''(\pi(x,\hat{B},\theta,\omega)-J(\bar\omega)\gamma)\frac{\partial \pi}{\partial x}(x,\hat{B},\theta,\omega)(-J(\bar\omega))d\omega\right] d\theta
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-egam}

Suppose insurance fully covers the loss between states, then utility in the good state and bad state are equal to each other so that we can factor out like terms in @eq-egam.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{U}{\partial x \partial \gamma}=\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}&j_{\theta}(\theta)J(\bar\omega)(1-J(\bar\omega))u''(\theta,\cdot)\\
&\left[ \int^{\bar\omega}_{-\infty}j_{\omega}(\omega)\frac{\partial \pi}{\partial x}(x,\hat{B},\theta,\omega)d\omega
-\int^{\infty}_{\bar{\omega}}j_{\omega}(\omega)\frac{\partial \pi}{\partial x}(x,\hat{B},\theta,\omega)d\omega\right] d\theta
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-simp}

The first term outside the brackets is negative by the definition of concave utility, $u''<0$. @lem-mp demonstrates the interior of the brackets is positive when $h_x(x)<0$ as the marginal profit in the bad state is greater than the marginal profit in the good. Therefore, index insurance will decrease input use for risk decreasing inputs when the shocks protected by insurance can be ameliorated through inputs and are independent of biological shocks.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{U}{\partial x \partial \gamma}=\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}&\overbrace{j_{\theta}(\theta)J(\bar\omega)(1-J(\bar\omega))u''(\theta,\cdot)}^{-}\\
&\left[ \int^{\bar\omega}_{-\infty}\underbrace{j_{\omega}(\omega)\frac{\partial \pi}{\partial x}(x,\hat{B},\theta,\omega)d\omega
-\int^{\infty}_{\bar{\omega}}j_{\omega}(\omega)\frac{\partial \pi}{\partial x}(x,\hat{B},\theta,\omega)d\omega}_{+}\right] d\theta\\
<0
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-gs}

When $h_x(x)>0$, the interior sign of the brackets is negative by @lem-mp. Therefore, index insurance will increase input use for risk increasing inputs. 
:::

Our specification of fishery index insurance has the same outcomes as demonstrated by @Mahul2001, @Ramaswami1993, and @Bulte2021 when biological and productivity risk are independent. The variance of biological risk influences optimal decisions in magnitude, but not direction. Including basis risk introduces additional considerations. Independence bookends the highest level of basis risk, where the biological risk is completely uncorrelated with the productivity risk. If we assume $\omega$ and $\theta$ are perfectly correlated we close the space of basis risk so that index insurance completely protects against all risk.

:::{#prp-corr}
For feasible index insurance contracts specified at trigger $\bar\omega=0$, when $\omega$ and $\theta$ are perfectly correlated random variables, optimal fisher input is ambiguous when $h_x(x)<0$ and increases when $h_x(x)>0$.
:::

:::{.proof}

Perfect correlation implies $\theta<0$ when $\omega<0$ and $\theta>0$ when $\omega>0$ since both distributions have mean zero, $\mathbb{E}[\theta]\equiv\mathbb{E}[\omega]=0$. The bounds of the integral with respect to $\theta$ can be separated

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{U}{\partial x \partial \gamma}=&\int^{\bar\omega}_{-\infty} \int^{\bar\omega}_{-\infty}j_{\omega,\theta}(\omega,\theta)u''(\pi(x,\hat{B},\theta,\omega)+(1-J(\bar\omega))\gamma)\frac{\partial \pi}{\partial x}(x,\hat{B},\theta,\omega)(1-J(\bar\omega))d\omega d\theta\\
+&\int^{\infty}_{\bar\omega}\int^{\infty}_{\bar{\omega}}j_{\omega,\theta}(\omega,\theta) u''(\pi(x,\hat{B},\theta,\omega)-J(\bar\omega)\gamma)\frac{\partial \pi}{\partial x}(x,\hat{B},\theta,\omega)(-J(\bar\omega))d\omega d\theta
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-per}


Suppose insurance fully covers the loss between states, then utility in the good state and bad state are equal to each other so that we can factor out like terms in @eq-per.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{U}{\partial x \partial \gamma}=u''(\cdot)J(\bar\omega)(1-J(\bar\omega))&\int^{\bar\omega}_{-\infty} \int^{\bar\omega}_{-\infty}j_{\omega,\theta}(\omega,\omega)\frac{\partial \pi}{\partial x}(x,\hat{B},\theta,\omega)d\omega d\theta\\
-&\int^{\infty}_{\bar\omega}\int^{\infty}_{\bar{\omega}}j_{\omega,\theta}(\omega,\theta) \frac{\partial \pi}{\partial x}(x,\hat{B},\theta,\omega)d\omega d\theta
\end{aligned}
$$

We expand @lem-mp to include $\theta$ while correlated to $\omega$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial \mathbb{E}[\pi|\omega<\bar\omega]}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial \mathbb{E}[\pi|\omega>\bar\omega]}{\partial x}=\cancel{f_{x}(x)}\hat{B}+\mathbb{E}[\theta f_x(x)|\omega<\bar\omega]+\mathbb{E}[\omega h_{x}(x)|\omega<\bar\omega]-\cancel c(x)\\
-\cancel{f_{x}(x)}\hat{B}+\mathbb{E}[\theta f_x(x)|\omega>\bar\omega]+\mathbb{E}[\omega h_{x}(x)|\omega>\bar\omega]-\cancel c(x)
\end{aligned}
$$

When $h_x(x)<0$, the positive $f_x(x)$ adds ambiguity making it impossible to sign the direction of the marginal profits states and therefore the optimal input direction in @eq-per.

When $h_x(x)>0$, both risk effects are increasing and the difference in marginal profits between states is unambiguously negative. Therefore, index insurance will increase input use for risk increasing inputs.
:::

@prp-corr shows a tension arises when biological risks are correlated with productivity risks. Insurance replaces the variance reduction benefits of risk decreasing inputs incentivizing less use. However, less input use will also lead to less harvest. Fishers decide whether the relative loss in income for lower variance is worthwhile. When $\theta$ and $\omega$ are perfectly correlated with each other, insurance covers biological variance as well as productivity variance. Mitigating biological risk then encourages fishers to expand production as insurance compensates some of the additional increasing risk of $\theta f(X)$. Whether fishers reduce or increase harvest depends on the effect of many factors such as the relative proportion of risk decreasing or increasing capacity of the input, degree of risk aversion, and the magnitude of variance between shocks. 

Index insurance will effect fisher input use. It remains unclear whether this could lead to improvements in fishery conservation. We explore the biological effects of index insurance in the next section in a setting of weak property rights to show unconstrained fisher behavior could improve or degrade fish stocks.

# Index Insurance effects on fishery conservation {#sec-bio}

The race to fish incentive in fisheries encourages myopic behavior. Fishers do not make decisions on the long run welfare of the fishery, but rather as a series of short run optimizations. However, their decisions on input use directly impact the biological sustainability of the fishery. Biomass growth into the next period is dependent on harvest in the current period. We add dynamics into the model to show how index insurance will impact biological conservation of fishery resources.

Biomass in the next period, $\tilde{B}_{t+1}$, is a function of the current period's biomass, a growth function $G(\tilde{B})$, and harvest, $y_t$.

$$
\tilde{B}_{t+1}=\tilde{B}_t+G(\tilde{B}_t)- y_t(x,\tilde{B}_t,\omega,\theta)
$${#eq-biodyn}

The stochastic nature of biomass in the current period spills over into the next period, creating a challenge to extract concise insights. To find clearer interpretations, we focus on the expectation of next period biomass, $\mathbb{E}[\tilde{B}_{t+1}]$. The expectation of $\omega$ and $\theta$ is zero, which allows us to focus on the mean production function, biomass, and a deterministic growth function.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{E}[\tilde{B}_{t+1}]&=\mathbb{E}[\tilde{B}_t]+\mathbb{E}[G(\tilde{B}_t)]- \mathbb{E}[y_t(\tilde{B}_t,\omega)] \\
\hat{B}_{t+1}&=\hat{B}_t+G(\hat{B}_t)-\hat{B}_t f(x)
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-exbiodyn}

We can use the expected biomass to approximate a potential steady state in order to predict the conservation effects of changes in input use from index insurance. For convenience, we assume a logistic growth function, $G(\hat{B})=r\hat{B}(1-\frac{\hat{B}}{K})$, where $r$ is the intrinsic growth rate and $K$ is the carrying capacity of the fishery.  We can find the expected steady state biomass by setting $\hat{B}_{t+1}=\hat{B}_t$ in @eq-exbiodyn.

$$
\hat{B}=K\left(1-\frac{f(x)}{r}\right)
$$ {#eq-ss}


:::{#prp-cons}

If index insurance leads to less mean production, $f(x)$, then the expected steady state biomass will increase. If index insurance leads to more mean production, then the expected steady state biomass will decrease.

:::

:::{.proof}


The change in aggregate harvest is always negative due to the concavity of mean production $f(x)$.

$$
\frac{\partial \hat{B}}{\partial x}=-\frac{Kf_{x}(x)}{r}
$$

If insurance raises $x$, then the expected steady state biomass will decrease. If insurance lowers $x$, then the expected steady state biomass will increase.

:::

The results of @prp-cons are summarized in @fig-synas with a simple linear mean production function, $f(x)=qx\hat{B}$. Mean production technology generates an expected steady state when it intersects mean biological growth. Index insurance shifts the technology function through adjustments in optimal inputs that originate from the fishers myopic optimization problem. Insurance increases risk increasing inputs shown as a shift to the left in the mean production curve. The new expected steady state equilibrium has a lower expected biomass than the initial equilibrium without insurance.

Insurance lowers the use of risk decreasing inputs and shifts the mean production function to the right. The new expected steady state equilibrium has a higher expected biomass than the initial equilibrium without insurance.

Throughout the remainder of the paper we focus on the input decisions of fishers as they directly lead to changes in fishery conservation. Many fishery biological models have simple elasticities on biomass that responded to inputs. This implies that changes in the underlying use of inputs will lead to comparable changes in fishery conservation.

Single variable aggregate effort measures are useful in surplus-production models, but do not reflect the complexity of fisher decisions.  @Asche2020 demonstrates fishers often use multiple inputs to harvest fish. Index insurance may raise or lower individual inputs depending on their own unique risk effects, but the overall direction of harvest decisions may not be so clear. Interactions between the inputs could override effects of index insurance on individual inputs. Little research has been done on multiple input insurance models. @Ramaswami1993 only examined the total production variance impacts on total harvest changes with insurance, but does not elaborate on the response of specific inputs. The next section explores how multiple inputs interact with each other and insurance to provide a a more comprehensive picture of how index insurance will impact fisheries.

# Insurance with multiple inputs {#sec-multi}

We simplify the general model in @eq-max by using two inputs, $X\in\{{x_a,x_b}\}$ to better understand the impact of insurance on multiple fishery inputs. Adding more variables complicates the model without adding any additional insights. The complexities of input interactions sufficiently arise with two inputs to demonstrate our intended purpose.

We postulate reasonable assumptions on the second derivative of the production risk function to assist with comparative statics later on. The marginal impact of adding an input to production variance should have diminishing effects, because it is impossible to completely eliminate risk or experience infinite risks. Therefore, when $h_{x_a}(X)>0 \rightarrow h_{x_ax_a}(X)<0$, and when $h_{x_a}(X)<0 \rightarrow h_{x_ax_a}(X)>0$. The cross partial of risk effects on production $\frac{\partial h}{\partial x_a \partial x_b}$ must also be flexible and depend on how inputs interact with each other. For example, if adding an input does not contribute to the marginal risk effect of another input then $\frac{\partial h}{\partial x_a \partial x_b}=0$. Inputs interactions could be complementary in that adding a risk decreasing input further enhances the risk reducing properties of the other inputs, $\frac{\partial h}{\partial x_a \partial x_b}>0$. In other instances the inputs may interact counter actively in that adding more of a risk increasing input might reduce the effect of a risk decreasing input, $\frac{\partial h}{\partial x_a \partial x_b}<0$. In principle, when inputs share the same direction of risk effects, their cross partial ought to be complementary, and when inputs have opposite risk effects they will be counter productive.

We use the same insurance design from the previous section where payouts, $\gamma$, are triggered by $\omega<0$, and we can partition profit into good states and bad states. Fishers now maximize expected utility by selecting two inputs.

$$
\begin{aligned}
U\equiv\max_{x_a,x_b}\mathbb{E}[U]=\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}&\left[ \int^{\bar\omega}_{-\infty}j_{\omega,\theta}(\omega,\theta)u(\pi(X,\hat{B},\theta,\omega)+(1-J(\bar\omega))\gamma)d\omega \right.\\
&\left.+\int^{\infty}_{\bar{\omega}}j_{\omega,\theta}(\omega,\theta) u(\pi(X,\hat{B},
\theta,\omega)-J(\bar\omega)\gamma)d\omega\right] d\theta
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-max2}


Taking the first order conditions yields:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial U}{\partial x_a}=&\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}\left[ \int^{\bar\omega}_{-\infty}j_{\omega,\theta}(\omega,\theta)u_{x_a}(\pi(X,\hat{B},\theta,\omega)+(1-J(\bar\omega))\gamma)\frac{\partial \pi}{\partial x_a}(X,\hat{B},\theta,\omega)d\omega\right.\\
&\left.+\int^{\infty}_{\bar{\omega}}j_{\omega,\theta}(\omega,\theta) u_{x_a}(\pi(X,\hat{B},\theta,\omega)-J(\bar\omega)\gamma)\frac{\partial \pi}{\partial x_a}(X,\hat{B},\theta,\omega)d\omega\right] d\theta\\
\frac{\partial U}{\partial x_b}=&\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}\left[ \int^{\bar\omega}_{-\infty}j_{\omega,\theta}(\omega,\theta)u_{x_b}(\pi(X,\hat{B},\theta,\omega)+(1-J(\bar\omega))\gamma)\frac{\partial \pi}{\partial x_b}(X,\hat{B},\theta,\omega)d\omega\right.\\
&\left.+\int^{\infty}_{\bar{\omega}}j_{\omega,\theta}(\omega,\theta) u_{x_b}(\pi(X,\hat{B},\theta,\omega)-J(\bar\omega)\gamma)\frac{\partial \pi}{\partial x_b}(X,\hat{B},\theta,\omega)d\omega\right] d\theta\\
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-foc2}

Given the first order condition is satisfied, we can use the implicit function theorem (IFT) to look at the impact of a change in the exogenous insurance contract locally at the input solutions. Applying IFT and Cramer's Rule yields a system of equations that determine the impact of insurance on each optimal input:


$$
\begin{aligned}
&\frac{\partial x_a}{\partial \gamma}=\frac{-1}{Det}\left[\frac{\partial U}{\partial x_b \partial x_b}\frac{\partial U}{\partial x_a \partial \gamma}-\frac{\partial U}{\partial x_a \partial x_b}\frac{\partial U}{\partial x_b \partial \gamma}\right] \\
&\frac{\partial x_b}{\partial \gamma}=\frac{-1}{Det}\left[\frac{-\partial U}{\partial x_b \partial x_a}\frac{\partial U}{\partial x_a \partial \gamma}+\frac{\partial U}{\partial x_a \partial x_a}\frac{\partial U}{\partial x_b \partial \gamma}\right]
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-ivtsol}

Because the determinate will always be positive by the definition of the second order condition, we can focus on the interior of the brackets. If positive, then insurance will lower use of that specific input and vice versa if negative. The partial derivatives are necessary to sign @eq-ivtsol. Their complete derivations are included in the appendix. The complex interaction between the partial effects of inputs and insurance presents a challenge to understanding the impacts of index insurance on fisheries. Therefore, we only focus on the uncorrelated case where $\theta$ and $\omega$ are independent. Ambiguity already exists with some level of basis risk. Introducing additional ambiguity only obsurces insight further.

Specific conditions must be met to determine the overall impact of index insurance on inputs, otherwise the effect could go either way despite the risk increasing or decreasing characteristic of an individual input.


:::{#prp-samre}
In fisheries with two inputs, when $\theta$ and $\omega$ are uncorrelated, index insurance will change the optimal use of a specific input in accordance to an input's own risk effect when the following sufficient condition is true:

$\frac{\partial U}{\partial x_a\partial x_b}>0$ when both inputs share the same risk effects, and $\frac{\partial U}{\partial x_a\partial x_b}<0$ when inputs have opposite risk effects.

Otherwise, Index Insurance will have ambiguous effects on optimal input choice. 
:::

The proof is included in @sec-samre and follows similar steps as the proof of @prp-ind while accounting for the partial effects of each input.

@prp-samre shows that index insurance can have clear impacts on input use even in complex settings with multiple inputs provided the sufficient condition holds. However, it is not clear ex-ante what the sign of the cross partial inputs of the first order condition should be. $\frac{\partial U}{\partial x_a\partial x_b}$ and $\frac{\partial U}{\partial x_b\partial x_a}$  themselves could be ambiguous. As shown in the appendix, rearranging $\frac{\partial U}{\partial x_a\partial x_b}$ and $\frac{\partial U}{\partial x_b\partial x_a}$ shows the relative weight between the marginal profits of each input and the risk effects cross partial influence the overall sign of first order cross partials.  Essentially, fishers change their inputs depending on whether a given input makes the other input more productive than the risk it adds. Whether inputs are complementary or counteractive in their risk effects influence the sign of the cross partial. When inputs share risk effects, they ought to increase the risk effects of each other. Therefore the cross partial is more likely to be negative when inputs share risk effects and positive when they are complementary following the sufficient conditions proposed in @prp-samre. 

Even with two inputs, ambiguity on the optimal use exists. Extending to more inputs introduces more interactions among the inputs, and the relatively weighting between marginal productivity and the risk effect cross partials is even harder to sign. @Ramaswami1993 used this complexity as a justification to only examine the total variance of production with a vector of inputs. @prp-samre helps elucidate his observations, while providing some understanding of how different inputs could change when fishers use a variety of inputs. Specific inputs could have different external environmental and community impacts. Being better able to predict how index insurance changes those inputs, and their ensuing impacts on a fishery, will help minimize any negative impacts that could arise.

Despite the seemingly rigid conditions, @prp-samre provides useful insight into the behavioral effects insurance will have when fishers use multiple inputs. It states that when the conditions hold, the direction all inputs should change is based solely on the characteristics of their own risk effects. Other inputs may influence the magnitude of change, but the direction is unequivocal. It remains unclear what the overall impacts on conservation will be in a multiple input setting. Differences in mean production elasticity lead to different magnitudes of change in input use. The overall change in harvest, and thus conservation, depends on the aggregate change in harvest. For example, a decline in use for a risk decreasing input compared to an equivalent increase in use of a risk increasing input may not lead to lower harvest if the risk increasing input is relatively more productive.

The next section uses simulations to show the total impact on harvest can vary substantially, and that the conditions to ensure unambiguous input change can be met. Though when applied with real world estimates of risk effects, the conditions may not hold and the effects of index insurance does not follow simple rules.

# Numerical Simulations {#sec-sim}

We use numerical simulation to show the ambiguity present in @prp-corr and to determine the magnitude of change in input use for Norwegian fisheries using the parameters found in @Asche2020. Monte Carlo simulations find expected utility across 1000 random draws of weather and biological variables. A comprehensive parameters test the sensitivity to different model parameters and the effects on optimal input choices. All simulations are conducted in R with accompanying code available at [WILL ADD ONCE REPO IS CLEANED].


## Simulations with biological risk

We use the structural form where $f(x)=x^\alpha$ and $h(x)=x^\beta$ to most easily integrate risk increasing or decreasing effects in $h(x)$. Mean production $f(x)$ is concave so that $\alpha>0$. Risk effects on the input can either be risk increasing or decreasing with $\beta\lessgtr0$. We apply convex costs, $c(x)=cx^2$, for smoother convergence in the maximization procedure. Biological and weather shocks are normally distributed with $\theta\sim N(0,\sigma_{\theta})$ and $\omega\sim N(0,\sigma_{\omega})$. The shocks are linked through a copula with correlations ranging from $[0,1]$. 

$$
\pi=x^\alpha(\hat\beta+\theta)+\omega x^\beta-cx^2
$$ {#eq-sim}

Fishers will choose inputs $x$ to maximize expected utility with an exogenous insurance contract. Constant Absolute Risk Aversion (CARA) utility is used to better account for negative shocks and profit loss. 

$$
\begin{aligned}
U&\equiv\max_{x}\mathbb{E}[u]=\mathbb{E}[(1-\exp(-a(\pi(x,\hat\beta,\theta)+\mathbb{I}(\gamma))]\\
\mathbb{I}(\gamma)&=\begin{cases}-\rho\gamma & \text{if } \omega\ge \bar\omega\\
(1-\rho)\gamma & \text{if } \omega<\bar\omega
\end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-maxsim}

We convert $\gamma$ to be a percentage of mean optimal profit without insurance for interpretability. For example, $\gamma=1$ would represent full coverage of deviation from pre-insurance profit, and $\gamma=0$ represents no insurance. The insurance contract is triggered by $\omega<\bar\omega$.

We create a wide parameter space to assess the sensitivity of optimal input choices to different model parameters. We vary the relative productivity of the input $\alpha\in\{0.25,0.5,0.75\}$, the risk effect of the input $\beta\in\{-0.7,-0.5,-0.3,-0.1,0.1,0.3,0.5,0.7\}$, the risk aversion parameter $a\in\{1,2,3\}$, the biological shock variance $\sigma_{\theta}\in\{0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4\}$, the weather shock variance $\sigma_{\omega}\in\{0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4\}$, and the correlation between the shocks $\rho\in[0,1]$. 

First we iterate $\gamma$ from $0$ to $2$ to show the change in optimal input use for a single input. Selected parameters for @fig-iter are for demonstration purposes. The full parameter space is explored in the accompanying code.

Optimal input use changes monotonically with index insurance depending on the risk characteristics of the input. Risk increasing inputs always increase with insurance. Risk decreasing inputs are ambiguous following @prp-ind and @prp-corr. When the insured weather shocks are perfectly correlated with biological shocks, the risk protection from insurance spills over to fishers encouraging them take on more fish with expanded production. 

The concavity of utility use implies there exists an optimal amount of insurance for fishers to buy. An endogenous choice of $\gamma$ will also maintain the same sign of optimal input use because input use is monotonic in $\gamma$. However, the magnitudes of input use change will depend on the level of $\gamma$. Allowing fishers to choose insurance coverage ensures that the choice of insurance and input use changes are welfare improving and will not bias input choices with over or under investment of insurance. Simulations moving forward will allow fishers to choose both inputs and insurance coverage.

Adding this to @eq-maxsim amends the choice set:

$$
\begin{aligned}
U&\equiv\max_{x,\gamma}\mathbb{E}[u]=\mathbb{E}[(1-\exp(-a(\pi(x,\hat\beta,\theta)+\mathbb{I}(\gamma))]\\
\mathbb{I}(\gamma)&=\begin{cases}-\rho\gamma & \text{if } \omega\ge \bar\omega\\
(1-\rho)\gamma & \text{if } \omega<\bar\omega
\end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-maxsim2}


Basis risk impacts the optimal choice of input, but the interaction between the biological productivity and the risk effects of the input are the primary drivers (@fig-corr). When mean productivity is relatively low, basis risk has a negligible impact on the optimal input use. Basis risk is more consequential at higher levels of mean productivity.  The trade off of less risk from insurance and loss of income through lower production is far more salient. High risk decreasing inputs see small levels of reduction when shocks are uncorrelated. With less basis risk, fishers are willing to increase use of risk decreasing inputs to capture more fish as insurance protects all types of risk.

Magnitude and sign of input change are sensitive to other parameters. @fig-sum shows that on average, insurance decreases risk decreasing input use by much smaller magnitudes than the proportional rise in risk increasing input use. At moderate levels of mean productivity, the average risk decreasing sees an increase for low levels of risk aversion and low degrees of weather variation. 

More risk averse fishers respond more aggressively to insurance and make relatively more changes toward their input decisions (Panel A in @fig-sum). Risk aversion implies more sensitivity towards risk. The protection from insurance has greater marginal value for more risk averse fishers. Greater marginal value of insurance means they can invest less into risk reducing inputs than before, and have more protection from greater shocks with risk increasing inputs.

Fisher input choice are much more responsive to insurance protection from larger productivity risks (Panel B @fig-sum). Similar to risk aversion, the greater the shocks the greater the marginal value of insurance is to mitigate those shocks. In more volatile environments, insurance provides significantly more income smoothing leading to similar incentives as the higher risk aversion example.

Trigger levels do not appear to have differing impacts on input use. Setting the trigger levels to more catastrophic coverage did not encourage fishers to change their input use relative to the other parameters. While necessary for applying @lem-mp in the proofs, the results of @prp-ind and @prp-corr would appear to hold if $\bar\omega\ne0$.

In the next section we use parameters from @Asche2020 to calculate the overall change in harvest with multiple inputs interacting with index insurance. These simulations will also show the conditions of @prp-samre do not hold in real world fisheries.


## Application to Real World Fisheries

Asche et al., (2020) aggregated by vessel type and not species, so there is no reasonable estimate for biomass. They accounted for biomass using fixed effects in their regression, but without additional information we cannot parameterize the mean and variance of biomass. Therefore, our simulations normalize mean biomass to 1 and we assume the biomass shocks are uncorrelated with the risk fishers mitigate through $h(X)$. Norwegian fisheries are well managed so the biological variance could be mitigated through quota systems or accurate stock assessments. The simulation model uses three inputs (capital $k$, labor $l$, and fuel $f$) instead of one.

$$
\pi(k,l,f)=k^{\alpha_k}l^{\alpha_l}f^{\alpha_f}+\omega k^{\beta_k}l^{\beta_l}k^{\beta_f}-c_kk^2-c_ll^2-c_ff^2
$$ {#eq-sim3}

Fishers in the simulation choose inputs and insurance coverage to maximize expected utility.

$$
\begin{aligned}
U&\equiv\max_{\gamma,k,l,f}\mathbb{E}[u]=\mathbb{E}[u(k^{\alpha_k}l^{\alpha_l}f^{\alpha_f}+\omega k^{\beta_k}l^{\beta_l}k^{\beta_f}-c_kk^2-c_ll^2-c_ff^2+\mathbb{I}(\gamma)]\\
\mathbb{I}(\gamma)&=\begin{cases}-\rho\gamma & \text{if } \omega\ge \bar\omega\\
(1-\rho)\gamma & \text{if } \omega<\bar\omega
\end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-maxasche}

@tbl-asche shows the production and risk elasticities of the four vessel types used in the simulation. While not all elasticities were found to be statistically different from zero, we used their raw values because dropping only those variables that are significant in both matching parameters would have kept only a few valid combinations. All non-significant elasticities led to small changes as expected, but their interactions with other inputs could partially drive some of the observed outcomes.

Overall harvest changes from index insurance depend on interaction of inputs, risk aversion, and the degree of varibilaity in the shocks.

Applying index insurance in Norwegian fisheries will lead to changes in input use and overall harvest. @tbl-asche shows that index insurance leads to a wide range of possible harvest outcomes. The coastal groundfish fishery observed the largest increase in harvest with most simulations yielding around a 12.5% increase in harvest.  This was driven primarily by increases capital (@fig-asche-input). All inputs had relatively similar mean production elasticities, but capital is strongly risk increasing with the highest positive risk elasticity. Labor is a risk decreasing input, but also rises with insurance. This is an example where the conditions of @prp-samre do not hold. The large discrepancy in production risk elastiticites is probably a reason for this in addition to the interactions terms at play by adding the third fuel input. 

Purse seiners see the largest reduction in overall harvest, though relatively small at only 4%. Capital for purse seiners is the most productive input out of all fisheries and inputs. Because it is risk reducing, it dominates the slightly risk increasing fuel input to lead the entire fishery to reduce harvest.  This shows another case where the conditions of @prp-samre do not hold. Fuel use is risk increasing, yet on average declines with index insurance. The ambiguity of risk decreasing inputs remains present even in the strongest case. While the median harvest decline is 4%, there are still conditions with high bioloigcal stochasticity and correlation that encourage fishers to use more capital with insurance despite its risk decreasing nature. Labor allocations did not change. No labor was allocated in either optimal choice, because the production elasticity was negative. 

Coastal seiners show the conditions for @prp-samre can hold in the real world with multiple inputs. In general, all input use changes follow their respective risk effects. Capital (0.44%) and fuel (0.11%) both increased, while labor (-1.01%) decreased. In aggregate, there was a small reduction in harvest (-0.3%). While insurance led to a change, it was rather small and would not have a large impact on the fishery. The counteractive effects of the risk effects may negate some of the desire to change production as insurance incentivizes both increases and decreases in harvest.

Inputs in the groundfish trawler industry are all risk reducing. Trawlers see a consistent 1.5% decrease in harvest.  Capital is extremely risk reducing and is lower in nearly every simulation, but is a relatively less productive input so overall harvest changes are small. 





# Discussion {#sec-disc}

Index insurance will have behavioral impacts on fishers' input decisions, which in turn will lead to changes in fishery sustainability. The direction and magnitude of impacts are primarily sensitive to the risk effects of inputs used in production and can have ambiguous outcomes. The traditional way of accounting for biological risk in fishery models predicts that index insurance will always increase fishing pressures. These models are inherently risk increasing and do not adequately capture deeper risk mitigation strategies.  Incorporating more flexible production models that allow for both positive and negative risk effects presents a more nuanced view of moral hazards in fishery index insurance. 


The fundamental driver of fishers' behavior changes is whether the marginal change in productivity is balanced by the marginal change in risk. Fishers are more willing to increase production if insurance negates the additional risk of expanded production. When insurance lowers risk, fishers need less self insurance through risk reducing inputs and can reduce their use. However, using less inputs implies less available catch and revenue creating a unique tension that exists throughout our analysis. Across all simulations, decreased input use was proportionally smaller than increased input use holding all other parameters constant. Behavior change in fisheries will lean towards expanding production creating a dilemma for conservation efforts.

As shown in this paper, harvest pressures could reduce by 4% in Norwegian purse seiners. Norwegian coastal groundfish trawlers were incentivized to increase their harvest by 12.5% with index insurance. Without more specific biological information, we cannot extrapolate the total effect on fish abundance.  The magnitude of harvest change indicates while index insurance may not be a conservation panacea in isolation, it also may not be a destructive tool. The decision to develop index insurance should revolve around whether it provides sufficient financial relief for fishing communities when designed to minimize negative impacts on fish stocks. While not the focal point of this paper, the average gain in utility for Norwegian fishers from is 7% indicating that index insurance can achieve welfare improving outcomes for fishers moving forward.


Risk effects remain an elusive concept in fisheries and need to reconciled in order to articulate more accurate behavior changes of fishery index insurance. Crop covers and pesticide provide clear examples of risk decreasing inputs in agriculture, but what do risk decreasing inputs look like in fisheries? @Asche2020 provide empirical evidence of the existence of risk decreasing inputs, but do not elaborate on why or how labor and capital directly decrease risk. Labor is perhaps the more intuitive risk decreasing input. Technical expertise of crew and captains can hedge against luck when fishing [@Alvarez2006]. Better trained crew can deploy gear in a safe and timely manner, increasing the likelihood of effective sets. 

Fuel as a risk increasing input in fisheries makes intuitive sense as well. Fuel is used to power vessels and is a direct cost of fishing. The more fuel used, the more fishing is occurring. The more fishing that is occurring, the more risk is being taken on. Every hour at sea increases the reward, but also the chances of failure.

Capital is a more complex input, because it can be both risk increasing and decreasing. Capital investments in fisheries typically refer to vessel tonnage, engine power, and gear technology. The spatiotemporal dimension of fishing decisions may explain how capital can potentially possess both risk effects.  Fishers have to make decisions on where, when, and how long to fish that differ from the set grids of agriculture [@Reimer2017]. Capital offers protection from risk by allowing fishers to explore more fishing grounds, use more secure gear, and fish in more adverse weather conditions. When common pool resources incentivize the race to fish, having larger vessels may be a risk reducing input as the sooner a fisher harvests from the stock, they assure their income at the expense of other fishers. Adding risk aversion to standard models of common pool fisheries suggests fishers should lower their capital use compared to risk neutral allocations [@Tilman2018;@gibbons1993]. Yet, overcapitalization and overfishing are more often observed in the real world. Either fishers are never risk averse or the risk effects of capital are not as simple as the standard model suggests. When capital is allowed to be risk decreasing, optimal input choices are much higher than risk neutral equilibrium suggesting fishers are making rational, risk averse decisions even while overfishing. 

Biomass is a crucial fishery input that separates our analysis from prior agricultural analyses. Most bioeconomic models simplify the complex effects of stock dynamics into multiplicative forms as modeled in this paper with $f(X)\hat\beta+\theta$. However, different forms of risk could be embedded into the biological component of fishery models. Stock variance could be greater in overfished stocks instead of healthier ones, reflecting more vulnerability in weaker states [@Sims2018]. The effects of insurance with these biological risk effects could lead to unique changes in fisher behavior. If insurance protects from more risk, fishers may be more willing to expose themselves to greater risk at more vulnerable stock levels. Alternatively, insurance could help mitigate risk and incentivize fishers to move toward healthier stocks with less variance by alleviating pressures to fish. Further analysis is required to understand the full implications of biological risk effects in fisheries.

The transfer between inputs and insurance reflects the substitution between self-insurance and formal insurance [@Quaas2008]. If index insurance is designed to reduce fishing capacity, efforts must be made to ensure that it does not take away from the self resiliency of fishers. Labor appears to be consistently risk reducing and acts as a form of self insurance. If index insurance incentivizes captains to hire less crew, the stock of fish may be preserved, but less employment may reverberate throughout the community. Fishing is often a primary employment opportunity in coastal communities. Lowering employment options may lead to increased poverty or concentrated wealth. The resiliency of the community would be compromised rather than enhanced. The same idea applies to capital. If fishers are over investing in capital to hedge against some form of risk, policymakers need to be sure the insurance is replacing maladaptive self insurance behavior.

The primary form of self insurance in fisheries is management. To this point our analysis explicitly modeled scenarios without the existence of management. Most fisheries are managed in some form. The interaction between management and insurance may be complementary or substitutes. For example, well managed fisheries that have responsive harvest control rules may not need insurance. The management system is already providing the necessary risk protection. Insurance demand and uptake may be low in these fisheries. Insurance could instead complement management to provide the financial relief that management cannot offer. Managers often focus on the biological health of the fishery that can run at odds with fishers' desires to enhance their income. Insurance can act as the financial relief and allow managers to pursue more active strategies to protect fish stocks without political resistance from lowered quotas. The interaction between insurance and management requires further investigation especially with the the numerous management strategies that exist in fisheries.

Design and access of insurance must also consider equity. The current US federal disaster relief program is inequitable with bias towards large industrial vessels [@Jardine2020]. Creating another program with equal inequity would be foolhardy. Current US farm subsidies, including insurance premiums, are heavily skewed towards large agribusinesses [@White2012]. Dimensions of access, procedural, representation, and distribution must all be built into the design of new fishery index insurance programs [@Fisher2019]. For example, small scale fishers may have income constraints that prevent them from buying the initial contract. Micro-finance options connected to insurance have been used in agriculture to alleviate this burden with some success [@Dougherty2021]. Additionally, we must ensure that is not only the vessel owners who reap the  benefits of insurance. Deckhands and crew are laid off during closures. If index insurance payouts are going through the entire fishery, the most vulnerable to closures must be protected as well. Contract stipulations could mandate that only cost expenses are covered by payouts thereby including lost wages to the crew. Agriculture contracts often are designed to directly cover expenses. Labor expenses could be included in the contract to ensure that the crew is protected as well.

Our model only directly models behavior change through moral hazards. Index insurance could be designed to incentivize other forms of sustainable behavior change. We define three pathways insurance can change behavior: Moral hazards, Quid Pro Quo, and Collective Action. Moral hazards were proven in this paper to have ambiguous impacts controlled by the risk characteristics of fishery inputs. 

Quid Pro Quo expands contract design to explicitly build in conservation measures. Fishers would be required to adopt sustainable practices in order to qualify for insurance. Quid Pro Quo is already used in agricultural insurance in the form of Good Farm Practices. Farmers must submit management plans to US Risk Management Agency that clearly outline their conservation practices in order to qualify for insurance. Working closely with management agencies, insurance companies could design contracts that require fishers to follow fishery specific management practices. For example, fishers may be incentivized to use more sustainable gear types, have an observer onboard, or reduce bycatch. Manager input is needed to tailor fishery best practices to insurance contracts. Further research would need to uncover the full impact of Quid Pro Quo, but an initial hypothesis would be the fishers will be willing to adopt sustainable practices so long as the marginal gain in utility from the insurance is greater or equal to the necessary sustainable changes. Otherwise fishers will not want to buy the contracts and the insurance has no binding stipulations to change the fishery. 


Collective action ties insurance premiums to biological outcomes to leverage the political economy of the fishery. Insures could reduce premiums in fisheries that have robust management practices such as adaptive harvest control rules, stock assessments, or marine protected areas in the vicinity. Fishers could either pressure regulators to adopt these actions or form industry groups to undertake the required actions. Insurers would agree to this if triggers are connected to biological health so that negative shocks are less frequent and thus payouts occur less. Fishers gain from the reduced insurance premium and the increased sustainability of harvest with rigorous management in place. 

Ultimately, if index insurance is to be used in fisheries, it must be designed with clear objectives and intentions. Index insurance can meet objectives of income stability and risk reduction. There has been an implicit assumption by practitioners that index insurance will always lead to improved sustainability. Without considering the behavior change of fishers when adopting insurance, the outcomes may not be as expected. New insights derived from this paper will help guide the efficient and sustainable implementation of fisheries index insurance.

## Proof of @lem-mp

**Lemma 3.1** *Individual fisher expected marginal profit of a specific input, $x_m$, is greater in the good state than expected marginal profit in the bad state when $h_{x_m}(X)>0$. Expected marginal profit is higher in the bad state when $h_{x_m}(X)<0$.  If $h_{x_m}(X)=0$, the marginal profits are equivalent in both states.*

:::.{.proof}
By the first order conditions, there exist optimal values of any individual input $x_m$  that must be chosen before the realization of the states of the world. Therefore $h(X^*)$, $f(X^*)$, and $c(X^*)$ are equal across states. 

Marginal utility in both states of the world is controlled by risk effects and the sign of the random variable $\omega$. If $\theta$ is independent of $\omega$, the expected value of $\theta|\omega\lessgtr\bar\omega=0$. Risk increasing inputs have $h_x(X)>0$ by definition. For any input denoted by $x$ this holds

$$
\begin{aligned}
\small
\frac{\partial \mathbb{E}[\pi|\omega<\bar\omega]}{\partial x^*_m}-\frac{\partial \mathbb{E}[\pi|\omega>\bar\omega]}{\partial x^*_m}=&\mathbb{E}[\omega h_{x_m^*}(X^*)|\omega<\bar\omega]+\cancel{f_{x_m^*}(X^*)\hat{B}}+\cancel{\mathbb{E}[\theta f_x(X^*)|\omega <\bar\omega]}-\cancel{c_{x^*_m}(X^*)} \\
&-\mathbb{E}[\omega h_{x_m^*}(X^*)|\omega>\bar\omega]+\cancel{f_{x_m^*}(X^*)\hat{B}}+\cancel{\mathbb{E}[\theta f_x(X^*)|\omega >\bar\omega]}-\cancel{c_{x^*_m}(X^*)}\\
=&\mathbb{E}[\omega h_{x_m^*}(X^*)|\omega<\bar\omega]-\mathbb{E}[\omega h_{x_m^*}(X^*)|\omega>\bar\omega]
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-comppi1}



If an input is risk decreasing then $h_{x_m}(X)<0$. Then @eq-comppi1 is positive and marginal profit in the bad state is greater than the marginal profit in the good state. Adding more of a risk reducing input reduces the negative impact in the bad state relative to the good state.

$$
\frac{\partial \mathbb{E}[\pi|\omega<\bar\omega]}{\partial x^*_m}-\frac{\partial \mathbb{E}[\pi|\omega>\bar\omega]}{\partial x^*_m}=\overbrace{\mathbb{E}[\omega h_{x_m^*}(X^*)|\omega<\bar\omega]-\mathbb{E}[\omega h_{x_m^*}(X^*)|\omega>\bar\omega]}^{+}
$$

Repeating the same thing for risk increasing inputs $h_{x_m}(X)>0$ shows that marginal profit in the bad state is less than marginal profit in the good state.

$$
\frac{\partial \mathbb{E}[\pi|\omega<\bar\omega]}{\partial x^*_m}-\frac{\partial \mathbb{E}[\pi|\omega>\bar\omega]}{\partial x^*_m}=\overbrace{\mathbb{E}[\omega h_{x_m^*}(X^*)|\omega<\bar\omega]-\mathbb{E}[\omega h_{x_m^*}(X^*)|\omega>\bar\omega]}^{-}
$$

If inputs have no risk effects then $h_{x_m}(X)=0$. Subbing into @eq-comppi1 shows there is no difference in marginal profits with no risk effects.

## Proof of @prp-samre {#sec-samre}

:::{.proof}


@lem-mp allows us to sign the partial equations $\frac{\partial U}{\partial x^i_a\partial \gamma}$ and $\frac{\partial U}{\partial x^i_b\partial \gamma}$ (@eq-kgam and @eq-lgam in the appendix) for any risk effect on either input. Concave utility by definition leads to $u_{xx}<0$. For simplicity, we will only focus on $\frac{\partial U}{\partial x^i_a\partial \gamma}$, but all applies equally to $\frac{\partial U}{\partial x^i_b\partial \gamma}$. Insurance payouts equalize profits between different states. If insurance completely covers all loss and $x^i_a$ is risk increasing, then $\frac{\partial U}{\partial x_a\partial \gamma}$ is positive.

$$
\frac{\partial U}{\partial x_a \partial \gamma}=\overbrace{\overbrace{(1-F(\bar\omega))u_{x_ax_a}(\cdot)}^{-}\overbrace{[\frac{\partial \mathbb{E}[\pi^i|w<\bar\omega]}{\partial x_a}-\frac{\partial \mathbb{E}[\pi^i|w>\bar\omega]}{\partial x_a}]}^{-}}^{+}
$$ {#eq-kgamsol}


Suppose both inputs are risk increasing so $\frac{\partial U}{\partial x^i_a\partial \gamma}$ and $\frac{\partial U}{\partial x^i_b\partial \gamma}$ are positive. The only way for @eq-ivtsol to be unambiguously positive is for $\frac{\partial U}{\partial x^i_a\partial x^i_b}$ and $\frac{\partial U}{\partial x^i_a\partial x^i_b}$ (@eq-crossl and @eq-crossk in the appendix) to be positive. 

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\frac{\partial x^i_a}{\partial \gamma}=\overbrace{\frac{-1}{Det}}^{-}\left[\overbrace{\overbrace{\frac{\partial U}{\partial x^i_b \partial x^i_b}}^{-}\overbrace{\frac{\partial U}{\partial x^i_a \partial \gamma}}^{+}\overbrace{-\frac{\partial U}{\partial x^i_a \partial x^i_b}}^{-}\overbrace{\frac{\partial U}{\partial x^i_b \partial \gamma}}^{+}}^{-}\right] >0\\
&\frac{\partial x^i_b}{\partial \gamma}=\overbrace{\frac{-1}{Det}}^{-}\left[\overbrace{\overbrace{\frac{-\partial U}{\partial x^i_b \partial x^i_a}}^{-}\overbrace{\frac{\partial U}{\partial x^i_a \partial \gamma}}^{+}+\overbrace{\frac{\partial U}{\partial x^i_a \partial x^i_a}}^{-}\overbrace{\frac{\partial U}{\partial x^i_b \partial \gamma}}^{+}}^{-}\right]>0
\end{aligned}
$$

Both risk increasing inputs will be raised with index insurance. Repeating the same steps above with risk decreasing inputs shows both inputs unambiguously decrease with index insurance.  

Now suppose inputs have mixed risk effects. For simplicity, $x^i_a$ will be risk increasing and $x^i_b$ will be risk decreasing. The results will hold for the opposite case. By @lem-mp, $\frac{\partial U}{\partial x^i_a\partial \gamma}$ is positive, while $\frac{\partial U}{\partial x^i_b\partial \gamma}$ is negative. @eq-ivtsol will be unambiguously positive if $\frac{\partial U}{\partial x^i_a\partial x^i_b}$ and $\frac{\partial U}{\partial x^i_b\partial x^i_a}$  are negative.

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\frac{\partial x^i_a}{\partial \gamma}=\overbrace{\frac{-1}{Det}}^{-}\left[\overbrace{\overbrace{\frac{\partial U}{\partial x^i_b\partial x^i_b}}^{-}\overbrace{\frac{\partial U}{\partial x^i_a \partial \gamma}}^{+}\overbrace{-\frac{\partial U}{\partial x^i_a \partial x^i_b}}^{+}\overbrace{\frac{\partial U}{\partial x^i_b\partial \gamma}}^{-}}^{-}\right] >0\\
&\frac{\partial x^i_b}{\partial \gamma}=\overbrace{\frac{-1}{Det}}^{-}\left[\overbrace{\overbrace{\frac{-\partial U}{\partial x^i_b\partial x^i_a}}^{+}\overbrace{\frac{\partial U}{\partial x^i_a \partial \gamma}}^{+}+\overbrace{\frac{\partial U}{\partial x^i_a \partial x^i_a}}^{-}\overbrace{\frac{\partial U}{\partial x^i_b\partial \gamma}}^{-}}^{+}\right]<0
\end{aligned}
$$

The risk increasing input will be raised with index insurance, while the risk decreasing input will be lowered.

If these conditions do not hold, then it is impossible to determine which additive element outweighs the other, and the insurance effects on optimal input use will be ambiguous regardless of the underlying risk effects of an input.

## Cross partial comparison

Dividing $\frac{\partial F}{\partial k\partial l}$ by $-\frac{u'}{u'}$ allows us to rearrange terms to show the tension between mean production and risk effects.

$$
\begin{aligned}
-\frac{\partial F}{\partial k \partial l}&=(1-p)u'\frac{-u''}{u'}\frac{\partial \pi_g}{\partial k}\frac{\partial \pi_g}{\partial l}-(1-p)u'\frac{\partial \pi_g}{\partial k\partial l}\frac{u'}{u'}\\
&+ pu'\frac{\partial \pi_b}{\partial k}\frac{\partial \pi_b}{\partial l}\frac{-u''}{u'}-pu'\frac{\partial \pi_b}{\partial k \partial l}\frac{u'}{u'}\\
&=(1-p)u'[\frac{-u''}{u'}]\frac{\partial \pi_g}{\partial k}\frac{\partial \pi_g}{\partial l}+pu'[\frac{-u''}{u'}]\frac{\partial \pi_b}{\partial k}\frac{\partial \pi_b}{\partial l}\\
&-(1-p)u'\frac{\partial \pi_g}{\partial k\partial l}-pu'\frac{\partial \pi_b}{\partial k \partial l}
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-crosssolve}


The concavity of profit with positive risk aversion $\frac{-u''}{u'}$ lead line 3 in @eq-crosssolve to be positive. The cross partials in line 4 paint a more complicated picture. Whether inputs enhance or reduce the risk effect qualities of each other influences the weight of line 4. When inputs share risk effects, they ought to increase the risk effects of each other so that $\frac{\partial h}{\partial k \partial l}>0$. Therefore line 4 in @eq-crosssolve becomes more negative as all terms are positive. It is relatively more likely that @eq-crosssolve is negative when risk effects are shared.

When risk effects are mixed, with one input increasing and one input decreasing, the risk effects counteract each other $\frac{\partial h}{\partial k \partial l}<0$. Line 4 in @eq-crosssolve becomes relatively less negative. If the difference between the risk effects cross partial $\frac{\partial h}{\partial k \partial l}$ outweigh the mean production cross partial $\frac{\partial f}{\partial k \partial l}$ then line 4 becomes unambiguously becomes positive. Then $-\frac{\partial F}{\partial k \partial l}>0$ and $-\frac{\partial F}{\partial l \partial k}>0$. The relative changes with complimentary or counteractive risk effects matches the signs needed for the condition in @prp-samre to hold.

## Extra proofs

:::{#prp-rn}
Risk neutral fishers will not change their input use with index insurance
:::

:::{.proof}
Risk neutrality implies that $u'(k,l)=0$ and $u''(k,l)=0$. Subbing $u''(k,l)=0$ into both @eq-kgam and @eq-lgam forces them to both equal zero. Plugging zero for $\frac{\partial F}{\partial l \partial \gamma}$ and $\frac{\partial F}{\partial k \partial \gamma}$ into @eq-ivtsol makes both elements also zero in the interior. Thus risk neutral fishers would not change input allocation with the addition of index insurance. 
:::

:::{#prp-rezero}
Index insurance will not change the input allocations when all inputs possess no risk effects.
:::


:::{.proof}
The second part of @lem-mp states that the marginal profits across states are equal. If the marginal profits across states are equal, then in @eq-kgam and @eq-lgam the weight between positive and negative utilities is also equal and cancel out leading to @eq-kgam and @eq-lgam both equaling zero. Plugging zeros into @eq-ivtsol for the insurance partials leads to an interior zero and no change in input use.
:::

Risk averse fishers will buy actuarially fair insurance. If the inputs possess risk effects then they will lead to changes in the input. @prp-samre defines the change in multiple inputs simultaneously with insurance.  

## Multiple Input simulation results {#sec-simres}

First, we present the simulations from the two input case to gain additional insight into how index insurance changes multiple inputs. Fishers earn profit through harvest with a Just and Pope production function with mean biomass normalized to one, and convex cost function. Inputs $X \in \{x_a,x_b\}$ are replaced with capital ($k$) and labor ($l$) to ground the interpretation of results in inputs practically used by fishers.

$$
\pi(k,l)=\hat{B}k^{\alpha_k}l^{\alpha_l}+\omega k^{\beta_k}l^{\beta_l}-c_kk^2-c_ll^2
$$ {#eq-sim}

Random shocks ($\omega$) are distributed normally with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of $\sigma_w$. Capital ($k$) and labor ($l$) have both mean production elasticities ($\alpha_k$ and $\alpha_l$) and flexible risk elasticities ($\beta_k$ and $\beta_l$). Fishers choose both capital and labor to maximize expected utility with constant absolute risk aversion (CARA).

Multiple index insurance policies are tested through changes in coverage and trigger levels. One scenario sets an exogenous constant payout amounts between 0-200% of pre-insurance profit, and the other allows fishers to endogenously choose payouts. The theoretical results of @sec-common and @sec-multi provide comparative statics on $\gamma$ payouts as a means to test whether some insurance is preferred to no insurance and how input use would change. Since the sign remains the same for any $\gamma$, the endogenous choice will also maintain the same sign. However, the magnitudes of input use change will depend on the level of $\gamma$. Allowing fishers to choose insurance coverage ensures that the choice of insurance and input use changes are welfare improving and will not bias input choices with over or under investment of insurance.

Trigger levels are set to engage at any below average weather or for shocks of more than 75% loss. All premiums are actuarilly fair. Risk effects vary between -0.7 and 0.7 with iterative increases of 0.1 ignoring situations of 0 risk effects. Fishers can posses low, medium, and high mean production elasticity values $\alpha\in\{0.25,0.5,0.75\}$. Coefficient of constant absolute risk aversion ranges from 1 to 3. Within each scenario, a Monte Carlo simulation creates 1000 weather random weather shocks with three variants of standard deviation $\sigma_w\in\{0.33,0.5,1\}$.

Increasing insurance incentivizes fishers to use more risk decreasing inputs and less risk increasing inputs (@fig-ins). These results confirm @prp-samre, and show the conditions of @prp-samre can be satisfied with CARA utility and a Just-Pope Production function (@fig-ins). The direction of input use is also stable as each class of input is monotonically increasing or decreasing with more insurance coverage. Inputs follow expected changes in use given their own risk effect even when risk effects are mixed. Capital is risk decreasing in the bottom left panel and decreases with more insurance while the risk increasing labor increases. The opposite trend occurs in the top right panel. The case where both inputs are risk increasing mimics traditional fishery models and shows that insurance will always increase input use.

Index insurance also increases utility shown by the green lines in @fig-ins, but there exists an optimal amount of insurance coverage for fishers.  The optimal values of insurance are generally lower when fishers use risk decreasing inputs. Notice the peak of the green line in the bottom right quadrant of @fig-ins is closer to 0 than that of the top left quadrant. Even in the mixed case, the optimal amount of coverage is lower than when both inputs are risk increasing. Risk decreasing inputs and insurance act as substitutes for each other as they both lower fisher income variance. Risk decreasing inputs still contribute to production while simultaneously reducing variance. Insurance lowers the need of risk decreasing inputs for their risk reduction qualities, but cannot fully compensate for the foregone production. Thus, fishers will choose to use insurance  until the opportunity cost of lost marginal production is equal to insurance gains in marginal risk protection.

Fishers are more willing to use risk increasing inputs with insurance because the insurance protects from the added risk of more inputs. Purchasing more insurance provides greater protection creating a feedback loop that greatly expands productive input use.

@fig-ins shows that conditions of @prp-samre can be satisfied, but it does not show the conservation outcomes of index insurance. Fishers use the new choice of inputs to change their overall harvest and thus impact on the biomass of fish stocks. Harvest changes are influenced by the relative combination of risk effects, mean production elastiticies, and the amount of insurance (@fig-multi-h-even).  Fishers reduce harvest more aggressively with risk decreasing inputs when offered a set contract of 50% coverage of pre-insurance profits (Panel A) relative to their optimal insurance choice (Panel B). Allowing fishers to choose their insurance coverage leads them to increase harvest more with risk increasing inputs. A 50% coverage is an overinvestment in insurance for risk decreasing inputs and an underinvestment for risk increasing inputs.

Mixed risk effects have more nuance in overall harvest as seen in the top left and bottom right quadrants of each panel in @fig-multi-h-even. Risk increasing inputs appear to dominant risk reducing inputs leading to generally more increases in harvest. For example, when an input has a risk increasing effect of 0.5, harvest still increases even if the other input has a stronger risk reducing effect at -0.7. The reduction in the risk decreasing output can outweigh the increase in the risk increasing input if the risk decreasing effect is much stronger than the risk increasing effect. For all risk effects at -0.7, when the other input has a risk effect <0.3, harvest decreases. In all cases, the change in harvest is quite small ranging from 0.8%-5%.

Increasing the mean elasticities exacerbates the discrepancies between changes in harvest through index insurance (@fig-multi-h-even-hi). When the productivity of harvest ($\alpha$) is higher, the tradeoff between reducing variance and catch changes. When the mean production elasticity is increased to 0.5, the maximum amount of observed harvest is 45% when fishers choose their insurance levels while the greatest reduction is only 8%. Higher mean elasticities imply a greater change in harvest and profit with changes in an input. Lowering use will have a proportionally greater tradeoff between risk protection and income for risk decreasing inputs at higher mean production elasticities.

The magnitude of input use also changes based on the fisher risk preferences, weather risk,  and contract terms. We extract simulation results where both inputs have the same risk effects and both have mean production elasticities of 0.5 ($\alpha_k=\alpha_l=0.5$) to more clearly isolate these effects (@fig-multi-para). More risk averse fishers respond more aggressively to insurance and make relatively more changes toward their input decisions (Panel A in @fig-multi-para). Risk aversion implies more sensitivity towards risk. The protection from insurance has greater marginal value for more risk averse fishers. Greater marginal value of insurance means they can invest less into risk reducing inputs than before, and have more protection from greater shocks with risk increasing inputs.

Fisher input choice are much more responsive to insurance protection from larger environmental risks (Panel B @fig-multi-para). Similar to risk aversion, the greater the shocks the greater the marginal value of insurance is to mitigate those shocks. In more volatile environments, insurance provides significantly more income smoothing leading to similar incentives as the higher risk aversion example.

Trigger levels also influence fisher behavior in interesting ways. When insurance covers more catastrophic events, such as shocks that are in the 75th percentile, fishers respond more aggressively if they are using risk decreasing inputs compared to risk increasing inputs (Panel C @fig-multi-para). Payouts occur in disastrous events at higher levels of coverage. When these larger shocks occur adding more risk increasing inputs could lead to more catastrophic outcomes. The incentive to increase input use is reduced in this case. Risk decreasing inputs on the other hand are more easily substitutable with insurance when greater shocks occur. Hence, the incentive for fishers to reduce input use is greater.
